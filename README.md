2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## 📐 Configure

- Edit the configuration file **src/data/site.config.ts** for the basic blog metadata.
- Update the **astro.config.mjs** file at the root of the project with your own domain.
- Modify the files in the **/public** folder:
  - favicon
  - robots.txt -> update the Sitemap url to your own domain
  - open-graph -> the open-graph is the image that will be displayed when sharing the blog link. For posts, the preview image is the post cover.
- Edit the social networks in the Header component - **src/components/Header.astro**, change the URL to your social network.

## 🗂️ Adding a category

To add a new category to your blog, simply go to the src/data/categories.ts file and add it to the array.

Example:

```ts
export  const  CATEGORIES  =  [
'JavaScript',
'React',
'new category here'  <---
]  as  const
```

> 🚨 Zod checks whether the category is not correctly written or does not exist in the properties of the markdown document. **It will throw an error when building the application.** 🚨

## 📄 Adding a post

Adding a post is as simple as adding a .md or .mdx file to the blog folder at the path **src/content/blog**. The filename will be used to create the slug/URL of the page.

For example, if you have a file named **jsx-and-react.md**, it will be transformed into: **http://yourdomain.com/post/jsx-and-react/**

## 📝 Activating draft mode

To activate draft mode, add the property **draft: true** to the file, and it will no longer be displayed on the blog.

Example :

```ts
title: MacBook Pro 2022
description: 'The new MacBook Pro 2022 is here. With the Apple M2 chip, a new design, and more, the new MacBook Pro is the best laptop Apple has ever made.'
pubDate: 'Jul 02 2022'
heroImage: '../../assets/bg.jpg'
category: 'Category 1'
tags: ['JavaScript', 'css', 'HTML5', 'GitHub']
draft: true <---
```
